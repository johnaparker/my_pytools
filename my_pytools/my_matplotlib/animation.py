"""Helper functions to perform animations"""

# Given X[N], Y[N,T], plot animated line
# Given f(x), f(y,t), plot animated line
# Repeat for X[Nx,Ny], etc, using pcolormesh or imshow and functional versions
    # included cmap/other controls for signed data vs unsigned
# For X,Y,U,V data, allow animated quiver

# animated sprites script. Allow  choice of filled vs. unfilled, full color control.
    # include option to show a trail of the trajectories
    # include rotations (circles included)

# possibly allow sprites, pcolormesh, and quiver animations to be overlapped easily
